                    <P>* The app takes advantage of dependency injection by using an IoC container to handle the newing up of objects
                    <br>* Used a MySQL database on the backend for data storage
                    <br>* Created a ProductRepository model with CRUD methods for inserting new products, displaying products, updating a product, and deleting products
                    <br>* The ProductController links the models to the views and calls the correct views to display depending on the user's interaction</P>

                <li>Best Buy CRUD Database Console: SQL | C# | .NET Core</li>
                    <P>* The BestBuy database simulates an inventory management system and employee sales records
                    <br>* Implemented a repository pattern to isolate the data access logic and business logic in order to allow for a more loosely coupled approach to data access from a sample BestBuy database
                    <br>* Demonstrated CRUD operations through a console user interface</P>

                <li>KanyeREST: C# | .NET Core| JSON | API</li>
                    <P>* This program will simulate a conversation between Kanye West and Ron Swanson through API calls
                    <br>* using the Newtonsoft.JSON NuGet package the program will make a call to the Kanye URL and parse the JSON object into a string called kanyeQuote
                    <br>* The application makes a call to the Ron Swanson API and parses the JSON Array into a string called swansonQuote
                    <br>* The program will chat using a loop to simulate the two talking back and forth until the loop finishes execution</P>

                <li>Tacobell Geolocator: C# | .NET Core | SQL | xUnit</li>
                    <P>* Uses a CSV file or a SQL database to populate an IEnumerable<Tacobell> called locations
                    <br>* Test-Driven Development using xUnit ensures that invalid or missing data is handled correctly
                    <br>* If the data is out of bounds or cannot be parsed, then the parse method returns null.
                    <br>* Finally, utilizing the Geolocator NuGet package, the program will calculate the two farthest Tacobells</P>
